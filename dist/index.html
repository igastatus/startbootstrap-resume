                           During my tenure as an Associate System Administrator at Trendyol Group in Istanbul, Turkey, over the past 2.5 years, I spearheaded initiatives that had a profound impact on the uptime performance and reliability of the leading e-commerce platform in Turkey. By meticulously configuring load balancing hardware and software, implementing strategic maintenance schedules, and actively participating in system upgrades, I significantly contributed to achieving and maintaining a remarkable 99% uptime. This stellar performance not only ensured uninterrupted access to the platform for millions of users but also played a pivotal role in enhancing the overall customer experience. My proactive approach to troubleshooting and resolving technical issues swiftly minimized downtime, demonstrating a commitment to the seamless operation of Trendyol's systems. As a result, I played a critical role in fortifying the platform's reputation for reliability, fostering user trust, and contributing to the company's success in the competitive e-commerce industry.

                            <p>
                                During the period from April 2019 to July 2021, I was employed in Istanbul, Turkey. I worked at GittiGidiyor, which is Turkey's leading e-commerce marketplace. GittiGidiyor was founded in 2001 and became a dominant player in the industry over the course of 16 years. In 2011, the company became a part of eBay, the world's largest online marketplace.

                                At GittiGidiyor, I contributed to the company's success as it solidified its position in the Turkish e-commerce market. With an average of 60 million monthly visits and nearly 19 million registered users, GittiGidiyor is the preferred online shopping platform in Turkey. The platform offers millions of products in over 50 categories, catering to individual sellers, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and large enterprises.
                                
                                During my time at GittiGidiyor, I was involved in various aspects of the company's operations. I worked as a Network Operations Center (NOC) Engineer, responsible for monitoring and maintaining the large computer networks and servers from a centralized location. My role included analyzing problems, performing troubleshooting and incident response, communicating with on-site technicians, and ensuring timely resolution of issues.
                                
                                GittiGidiyor prides itself on providing a secure shopping experience for its users. The platform utilizes a "Zero Risk" payment and confirmation system, ensuring 100% safe online transactions. This approach has helped GittiGidiyor gain the trust of its customers and fostered the growth of individual sellers, SMEs, and large enterprises on the platform.
                                
                                However, it is important to note that GittiGidiyor operations closed on July 22. This information should be taken into account when considering my experience at the company.
